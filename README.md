# TrashTrackr

An institute-based certificate validation and collection. Implemented through LAMP Stack. Works by checking embedded cryptographic hash.

## Note

I personally did this project to test out some SQL attack on LAMP-based environment. Feel free to do the same too.

## Features

- **Cryptographic Hashing for Certificate Validation**: Uses hashing techniques to generate unique identifiers for each certificate; Ensures tamper-proof verification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Accessible via Linux platform for seamless verification; Responsive and easy-to-navigate UI.
- **Instant Certificate Authentication**: Eliminates manual verification processes.
- **Centralized Certificate Repository**: A secure database storing certificate records for fast retrieval.

## Stack

- **Linux**
- **Apache**
- **MySQL/MariaDB**
- **PHP**
